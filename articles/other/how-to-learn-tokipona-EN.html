            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">Toki pona</a> is a constructed language created by Canadian linguist Sonja Lang in 2001. Toki Pona is famous because of its vocabulary and easy grammar. This language has 120 official words but there are also 10 more words that are widely spoken in the community. Because of its small vocabulary standard methods of learning language wouldn't be that effective for toki pona, so it needs a special way to learn.

            You could think that if this language has so few words then it would be a good idea to just read a dictionary and that's it but you're WRONG. Grammar in toki pona is really important due to its small vocabulary. To say video in English we use one word but in toki pona, it's gonna be something like sitelen tawa (moving picture). Yes, we must describe some things in toki pona instead of talking it with just word. Here is another example: forge in toki pona can be tomo pi ilo pali (a building where tools are created) the word "pi" just like li, e, and a, is just grammar word with no meaning in itself but it is essential to build sentences.

            So how to learn toki pona? Easily! There are a few ways:
        </p>
            <li>Standard method. Learn it through pu, ku, and su - official toki pona books.</li>
            <li>Community method. Learn it throw watching videos, like in Jan Misali on YouTube or throw website(that also contains videos) on <a href="mun.la/sona">mun.la/sona</a></li>
            <li>Have a friend tokiponist. Just try to talk with your friend who knows toki pona and ask him/her about words you don't understand</li>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Of course, there are also other ways to learn toki pona, but I think wouldn't be as effective as the methods I've mentioned earlier. But remember, this is not the only method to learn, and if you want, you can learn this simplistic language in any way you want.
